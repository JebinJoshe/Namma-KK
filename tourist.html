The Kodayar makes its descend at Tirparappu and the water fall at this place is about 13km. from Pechiparai dam. The river bed is rocky and about 300 feet in length. The water falls from a height of nearly 50 feet and the water flows for about seven months in a year. The whole bed above the falls is one rocky mass which extends up to a distance of about quarter of a kilometer upstream where the famous Thirparappu weir has been constructed for supplying water to the paddy fields. On either side of the river, on the left bank of the river in between the water falls and the weir, there is a temple dedicated to Siva enclosed by strong fortification.

        Padmanabhapuram Palace
    </h2>
    <img src="./c6.jpeg" alt="Padmanabhapuram Palace" class="main-logo" ><br>
    <p>
       <span class="ak"></span> The small village, Padmanabhapuram originally known as Kalkulam, in Kanyakumari district was once a thriving capital of the powerful Venad Kingdom which later became popular as the erstwhile princely state of Travancore. Padmanabhapuram was not the first stronghold of the Venad rulers in the South. The nearby Valliyur, Veerakeralaeswaram (also known as Veerakeralapuram), Thiruvithamcode, Charode, Puliyoorkurichi (Udayagiri), and Eraniel still have remnants of settlements, palaces, old fortifications and major temples that predate the foundation of Padmanabhapuram. Today there is no trace of the old palace in Keralapuram and Charode, but the ruins of a palace can still be seen in Eraniel. Kalkulam was probably chosen as an apt place for constructing a palace due to its strategic location and proximity to the rugged mountain ranges of the Western Ghats which provided natural protection to the palace and the settlements. The abundance of fertile farmland and plentiful supply of water were the major attractions that invited the royals and other settlers to this region.
